  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  Week 1 was an introductory class that detailed what should be expected throughout the course (22.03 - Introduction to Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping) in terms of assignments and class projects. We discussed how the most recent version of the course was run and how the students did on their version of a solar concentrator. This included in-depth explanations of the students’ different designs and each of the designs’ strengths/weaknesses to help guide us toward a more optimal design this semester.
