  ### Week 14: 

  **Monday:**

  On Monday, our group was finally ready to start the manufacturing process so we headed over to start thermoforming. The process involved using our mold that Justin milled out of the wood base from last week. Luckily we had just enough room in the thermoforming bay to fit our mold. 

  We started off with Justin showing us the ropes of the process. We heated up the plastic sheet, blew air into it to form a bubble, brought the mold up into the bubble, used a vacuum pump to suck the excess air out, and then cooled it off. When the plastic was cool we were able to break it free of the mold and take our pedal. 

  As you can see below, our first attempt at thermoforming was not a success:

  Although our first attempt was classified as a fail, we were able to learn from these mistakes in order to have nothing but successes after. We realized that we may have heated the plastic for too long and blew too much air into the bubble which caused a lot of excess plastic to wrinkle up on the mold. In order to fix this, we let the plastic heat up for exactly 90 seconds and only formed a small bubble in the plastic. While we can't be sure which one was the successful change, we do know that doing it this way gave us 6/6 successful attempts.

  And here is a video of the whole thermoforming process:

  After thermoforming, we had to take the sloped edges off of our pedals since they were never part of the design; they were simply there for ease in the thermoforming process. We used a box cutter to cut away these slopes and then afterward we took them to the grinding belt to get rid of excess plastic that wasn't part of the flanges and/or any sharpness from the plastic. We were able to complete 4/6 pedals this day, so we almost finished them entirely!

  **Wednesday:**

  On Wednesday, Xavier and I immediately headed back over to building 3 to finish up the grinding of the last two pedals. 

  Here is an image of Xavier grinding a pedal:

  While we did this, Brittany was able to stay behind and start the process of adding the reflective tape to the completed pedals. After Xavier and I finished up in building 3, we headed back over to help finish up putting the reflective tape on the pedals. 

  After we finished putting the reflective tape on, we started the process of actually assembling our reflector. We first put the brackets on so that we could mark the holes that needed to be drilled out (including parts of the pedals that weren't going to actually have a backet attached to them). During this, we unfortunately broke one of the brackets due to an oversight; when we first made the brackets, they were made to fit two sides of the pedals, but we didn't consider that we needed them to fit the pedals as well as the reflective tape on them which made for an uncomfortably tight fit.

  After we finished drilling all of the holes, we attached brackets where they should be and we attached the other parts of the pedals together simply using nuts and bolts. By the end of the day we had a completed reflector, just missing the one bracket!

  And here are two images of our assembly, including the final reflector:
