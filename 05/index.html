  ### Week 5: Continuing Construction 

  **Monday:** This week started off with us back in the shop to continue making progress on our reflector. We spent all of our class time using the laser cutter to cut out almost all of the reflectors that we needed for our initial test. After we cut them out, we attached what we had to the milled styrofoam stand, but we still needed the last two reflectors on the outter edge to finish it.

  Here are two images, one of the laser cutter in progress and another of our nearly finished tester reflector:

  **Wednesday:** On Wednesday, we were finally able to complete our tester reflector and do our first mini-test on it with a spotlight. Our testing proved to be a success and showed that we have a good start for our design. It was able to reflect a large amount of light back to a medium sized area which was very promising for us. After we wrapped up our mini-test, we headed over to the NEET lounge in order to use the 3D printers there. While we were there, we made progress on the 3D print of our stepper motor-driven motion device. This device will be used to control the motion of our solar concentrator as it tracks the sun across the sky.

  These are a few of photos showing our completed reflector, mini-test, and the 3D print in progress:
