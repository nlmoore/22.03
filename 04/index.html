  ### Week 4: Testing and Constructing

  Monday: Monday's class was focussed entirely on experimentation. We took all three solar concentrators to a high point (the roof of a 3-4 story building) to test which solar cookers would be able to boil water the quickest. The large dish-like solar concentrator worked the best- it was able to completely boil the pot of water. The second best concentrator was the yellow plastic one. At its maximum, it was able to get the water to about 56 degrees C. The GoSun solar concentrator was the least efficient- it was able to heat the water up to about 52 degrees C at its maximum. Its orientation is also made in such a way that it causes a large temperature gradient of almost 20 degrees C within the cooking chamber, making it even less effective. 

  Here is an image of the readings when the larger solar cooker got the water to a boil and another reading of the final temperatures of the other two:

  Wednesday: On this day, class was focussed entirely on starting the build of our first prototypes. We learned how to extract DXF files from our Fusion-360 farnell reflector in order to laser-cut our parts out. We learned how to correctly modify these files in order for the printer to cut them correctly and then we were finally able to cut a few parts out and make some progress.

  And here are a few images of our laser cutting process:
