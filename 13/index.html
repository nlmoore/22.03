  ### Week 13:

  **Monday:** On Monday I was still out of town. Again, my group was able to make good progress on our deisgns. Xavier was able to create a CAD sketch of our bounce mirror, but this time it included the holes for the support rods. 

  Here is an image of the updated bounce mirror sketch:

  **Wednesday:** On Wednesday I was back in town and back to work with my group. We started off in the shop gluing the base together. After that was quickly finished up we headed over to the classroom to make sure we were prepared to 3d print the brackets and bounce mirror. The bounce mirror was ready to go, but the brackets needed to be a little wider to give them more support.

  After we felt comfortable with the sketches, we headed over to the NEET lounge to 3d print our parts. Anna came with us to 3d print parts for the other group, so we were only able to print brackets at first. However, when we tried to print the brackets, the filament wasn't sticking correctly so we weren't able to get the brackets to print. Luckily, Justin was able to head over to the NEET lounge the next day to fix the issue and finish the 3d printing process for both the brackets and the bounce mirror.

  Here is an image of the bounce mirror after Prusa slicing and an imge of the print process:
