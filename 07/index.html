  ### Week 6:  

  Week 6 consisted of only Wednesday. I was out of town for this class, but the group made progress in my absence. From the information I was given, the class was able to test out our first partial-reflector. They were able to get a pot of water to heat up to about 60 degrees C in the time they had during class. This is quite impressive! When testing the store-bought concentrators, two of them were only able to reach around the mid 50s. That means our partially constructed concentrator was able to heat up the water more than two fully-built store-bought concentrators! Needless to say, this is a very positive result and we seem to be on a good path toward a functional and efficient solar concentrator.
