  ### Week 9:

  **Monday:** For Monday's class we split off into two groups. It was a nice day with a good amount of sunshine, so our group was tasked with determining an experimental value for the focal length of our main reflector as well as the bounce mirror. The other group was tasked with putting the finishing touches on our solar tracker pan-tilt device.

  Although it was a rough "experiment", we were able to gather important details about the two focal lengths that will help us later in the process when we attach our bounce mirror to the full reflector. We found that the reflector had a focal length of about 1.15 meters (1 m and 6 in) while the focal length of our bounce mirror was exactly what we were expecting/hoping for, 1 meter.


  Here are some images of our small scale focal length test:

  The other group did an amazing job with getting the solar tracker device working. They were able to get the device to follow the light indoors, so they decided to try it outside while we still had sunlight. The device had some hiccups from being moved outside, but after a few minutes of troubleshooting they were able to get it up and running again. Thankfully, we were finally able to see the device work correctly in the sunlight!


  Here is a video of the pan-tilt solar tracker working in the sun:

  **Wednesday:** On Wednesday, surprisingly, we had more sunlight! Since we had the sun, we decided to do a little more experimentation with design ideas while we had the chance. Specifically, we wanted to test if a conical light funnel would enhance our design, and if so, by how much? 

  To test this, we first created a cone out of posterboards and then taped reflective material to the inside. After about 10 minutes of testing, we decided the cone was too crude to get accurate results from, so we created a new cone.

  Here are images of the first cone we built:

  Our second cone was made with a bit more attention to detail so that we didn't run into the same problems as we did with the first one. We cut the posterboard into the shape of a cone that has been split vertically and laid flat. We then used spray adhesive to affix the reflective material to the inside of our new cone. After the reflective material was glued down, we rolled our posterboard into the shape of a cone and taped it together.

  Here is what our second cone looked like:

  Although we were able to make a better cone, we still wern't able to get great results. We used light resistors to determine if the light coming out of the cone was more intense than the sunlight without the cone. When using the resistors we found that there was a significant enough difference between the two readings that we can say the cone indeed intensifies the light, but it wasn't by a dramatic amount. We also tested to see if we could heat up some water quicker using the cone, but we didn't get very nice results. We focussed the light from the cone onto one spot on the side of the pot of water and after 15 minutes the spot was still cold to the touch. The results from the latter test could be skewed since it was done in less of a controlled fashion; rather than having something to hold the cone, we used people to hold it as still as possible, but most likely not as still as a brace would have been.
