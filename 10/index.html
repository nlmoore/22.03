  ### Week 10: 

  **Monday:** This week was done entirely in the classroom, mostly because we have very little sunlight due to daylight savings time. We started off with a deeper look at everyone's weekly website updates where we detailed the events that had taken place while Justin was away. 

  After this, we chose teams which were made from the part of the project we would want to work on the most. My team ended up being Xavier, Brittany, and myself, with Justin helping lead us. We chose to work on the design of the reflector where we ended up modifying it quite a bit. We decided it would be most efficient if we went with a curved parabolic reflector rather than the fresnel reflector due to its simplicity in the actual manufacturing process. 

  Toward the end of class we brainstormed on fusion and started our design process. There was very little class time left at this point, so we weren't able to come up with much.


  **Wednesday:** We started this day off immediately in our groups to continue our designing process. Our group was able to make a good amount of progress on our new reflector design. We decided on thermoforming our reflector as our preferred method of manufacturing. In order to do this, we needed to build the reflector in Fusion-360 using a semi-basic model that Justin drew up between classes. Using Justin's model we were able to establish numerical parameters for specific things like the diameter of the reflector, how many pedals we will use to assemble it, the diameter of the light pipe, the depth of the reflector etc. 

  With these parameters in place, we know the dimensions of our reflector and we should be able to start thermoforming our pedals very soon!

  Here is an image of the CAD design and its parameters that we plan to use for the actual reflector:
