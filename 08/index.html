  ### Week 8: 

  Monday: For Monday's class we started the class by looking at some of the sketches that students worked on over the weekend. After we went over a few of the sketches and discussed their strengths and weaknesses we split up into groups again. In one group, Justin helped the students troubleshoot some issues with the solar tracker. Unfortunately, the solar tracker was still not quite ready by the end of the class.

  My group consisted of me and Xavier with intermittent help from a few others. We were tasked with attaching the new reflective material to the reflector mirrors. We used exacto knives to cut the reflective tape into the shapes of the mirrored acryllic pieces. After we finished with that, we pressed on the material with flat and rigid objects to smoothen out the bubbles under the material. This smoothening process caused some smudging on the material that could possibly negatively effect its reflective properties.

  Here are two images, one of Tyler and Catherine troubleshooting the solar tracker and one of the updated reflector with its new reflective surface.

  Wednesday: On Wednesday we started class off by running another mini-test on the updated reflector and the new bounce mirror prototype that was made by cutting out the inner-most reflectors from the main reflector. We observed the reflective capabilites of the two components and noted that the main reflector still worked well, but the bounce mirror could use some modifications to optimize its abilities. 

  After the mini-test, we split up into groups again. Justin helped out with troubleshooting the solar tracker with the same students as Monday while Nathan and the rest of us worked in Fusion-360. Nathan gave us a step-by-step lesson on how to build our solar concentrator design in Fusion-360. We successfully built the reflector, bounce mirror, and light pipe (as well as a joint to replicate the reflector's ability to rotate as it follows the sun across the sky). The design is mostly just the basics at the moment, but we will be able to build off of this as we progress throughout the semester.

  Here is a video of my Fusion-360 solar concentrator sketch:
