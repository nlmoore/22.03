  ### Week 11: 

  **Monday:** On Monday we split into our groups to work on our specific part designs again. My group worked on the reflector design with Justin again while the other groups worked with Nathan and Joel to work more on designing how the concentrator will rotate. 
  Our group worked mostly on putting the finishing touches on the pedals of the reflectors to get them ready to be thermoformed. We needed to add a gradient to the sides of the pedals in order to make sure the thermoforming process goes as smoothly as possible. So instead of having a sharp cutoff at the edges, we had to add a slope that was greater than 7 degrees- we ended up making it much greater than 7 degrees to allow for plenty of error in that figure.

  This is our finished pedal design after adding the slope:

  **Wednesday:** On Wednesday we split into groups again. Since we finally finished the design for the pedal on Monday, we were able to create the toolpaths for the milling process. In our group, Justin showed us his process of creating the tool paths in Fusion-360. After he was finished creating the toolpaths, we were tasked with brainstorming design ideas for the bounce mirror. Justin explained the numerical system used for threaded rods and told us that quarter-inch 20 rods would probably be best for the supports on the bounce mirror. 

  Here is an image of Justin explaining the threaded rod numerical system:
