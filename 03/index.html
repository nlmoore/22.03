  ### Week 3: 

  **Week 3** For week 3, I was out of town and therefore not in class. Of course, the class was able to continue with our progress. From what I was able to gather, class was mostly focussed on finishing the construction of the final solar cooker before focussing on Computer Aided Design software like Fusion-360. Having this last cooker completed will allow us to test all of them together in a controlled environment such that we can learn more about which design's overall performance is best and what parts from each design we like the most. Having this information will help with our design process so we can identify which aspects we may want to use/modify for our own design. 

  They focussed part of the class on Fusion-360 because Fusion will be an integral part of our process. We can design things by hand, but it's a lot more tricky to do without the assistance of computer software when it comes to specific figures. Therefore, we are going to need Fusion a lot in the future when it comes to manufacturing any parts of our design.
