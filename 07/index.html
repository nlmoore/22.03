  ### Week 7:  

  Monday: On Monday, class was less hands-on than usual and more informative than anything. We were in the classroom for the full class learning more about Fusion-360 and how we can use it to aid in our design process. Justin taught us step-by-step how to make sketches in Fusion-360 and how to manipulate the 2D sketches into a reflector design. 

  
  Fusion-360 is a little difficult to work with in some aspects, but I think it does a great job showing us extra detail in the designs we have in our heads.

  Here is a screenshot of the sketch I worked on during class:

  After a decent amount of time working on developing our CAD skills, we took a look at the previous semester's prototype. We discussed some of the postive aspects to their design as well as some of the negative aspects. One big problem with the design was the fact that there was a lot of weight that would be in motion. The two stepper motors were required to move quite a heavy load in their design which was quite inefficient and difficult to achieve. To remedy this issue, for our design we discussed making it so that the stepper motors would only need to move the reflector which would cut out moving any unnecessary weight like the salt brick.

  Wednesday: On Wednesday, we split into two groups: one group was with Nathan working on getting our light detector working while my group worked with Joel to try and find a better reflective material for our design.
  
  Nathan's group unfortunately ran into some issues with the light detector, but it should hopefully be fixed and ready by next week.
  
  Our group taped 6 different materials (the acrylic material we started our design with, sheet metal, textured reflective tape, smooth reflective tape, a piece from the yellow reflector, and a piece of a colorful reflector)to a foam board and took them out in the sun with a thermal camera. We measured how hot each of the materials got to see how much they were reflecting. The materials that appeared cooler reflected more heat than the ones that were warmer because they didn't absorb as much of the heat, they were instead able to reflect it.
  
  We found that the reflective tapes and sheet metal were far more reflective than the other materials which appeared quite a bit warmer on the thermal camera. We suspect that the others may have warmed up due to either them being poor reflectors, or due to them having too much volume for the heat to store in, hence why the acrylic got so warm.

  Here are two images; one is of our materials on the foam board and the other is of us testing them in the sun.
