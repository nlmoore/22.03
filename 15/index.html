  ### Week 15: Final Presentation/Wrapping Up 

  **Monday:** Monday was our last full day of class to complete any parts of the concentrator that were unfinished and we still had quite a few things that were unfinished. To start the class, we needed to add the threaded rods to our brackets in order to attach the bounce mirror. To do this we needed to cut the 2 meter threaded rod into 3 equal parts, so we took a hand-saw and did just that. When we finished cutting the rod, we used some files to smoothen out the threads at the ends and the ends in general for overall safety (we didn't want to cut our fingers or hands attaching the bounce mirror). To attach our bounce mirror, we had to use nuts to keep it in place on the rods at the correct focal length determined in our CAD design which I believe was somewhere around 21 in.

  Here is an image of us using the nuts to adjust the bounce mirror distance:

  After we finished up with the rods and bounce mirror, we admired our work for a second. After a mini celebration, we took our reflector outside while there was still a small amount of sunlight left to test it as well as we could with the time we could "spare". Our test proved our reflector was pretty successful and we could tell our bounce mirror was at the correct distance from this image:

  After we finished our test, we headed back inside and started to help with mounting the motors and light pipe. When we started working on mounting the motors, we realized the shafts were too long and we needed a way to "shorten" them. To do this, we stacked washers and nuts on the screws that attached the motors to the structure. These washers and nuts acted as spacers to "shorten" the shafts on the motors. When we were finally done with this, we needed to attach the gears to the motors since they are what would ultimately create movement. Our gears didn't entirely fit, so we improvised with a small amount of hot glue to create more of a snug fit on the motors. When we finished with the gears and motors, it was time to attach the light pipe; the light pipe was relatively easy and brought up no unforseen issues, so it was done pretty quickly. 

  After these final steps were finished with the base, we were finally ready to put it all together. We brought the reflector over to the base and attached it to the two brackets specifically meant for this. When it was attached, we had a completed solar concentrator!

  Here is our finished product after a semester of hard work:

  **Wednesday:** Wednesday's class was not quite as exciting as Monday's, but we were able to "show off" our completed project to some guests! Nathan's group started in the shop making the finishing touches on the concentrator while Xavier, Brittany, and I stayed in the classroom finishing up the Google Slides presentation. Fortunately, Nathan's group was able to get the altitude degree of freedom to function correctly for the presentation, but unfortunately the azimuth angle was not able to work correctly. Given more time I'm confident they would have gotten it to work. Even with this setback, I am proud of what we were able to present and even more proud of the work we accomplished throughout this class!

  If you would like to see a presentational overview of the entire semester, here is a link to the Google Slides presentation that we used for our guests!
