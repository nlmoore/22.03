### Week 2: Brainstorming 

Monday: We began by choosing our teams based on which component of the solar concentrator interested us the most. After choosing our teams, we began brainstorming ideas that could help eliminate some design flaws in the original thermal battery. One of the most important flaws to work out was the air pocket at the top of the battery that causes less heat to emit from this area. To help remedy this design flaw, we started coming up with ways to force the air pocket into a chimney-like position that doesn’t necessarily need to be as hot since there’s nothing we can do to get rid of all the air. We are continuing to modify our original design, but the latest idea was to give the “chimney” a slope as to allow the molten salt an easy way to the chimney without having any amount of air at the top of the battery .

Wednesday: Week 2 ended with class being spent partially in the shop constructing purchased solar concentrators and partially outside testing the built concentrators. We tested these designs to see which parts from each concentrator worked best for our purposes. After testing how well two of our concentrators could boil/heat water, we found that one performed significantly better than the other. While one had only heated up the water a small amount (the pot being much hotter than the water inside), the other made the water hot to the touch.

We can render mp4 videos by writing: 

```
<video controls>
  <source src="./demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

Which should render like: 

<video controls>
  <source src="./demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
