  ### Week 12:  

  **Week 12** was the week of our Thanksgiving break and I was out of town for the whole week. Although I was out of town, my group was able to make some good progress on our reflector design. They decided that it would probably be best to 3d print the bounce mirror, rather than thermoforming it, to save on time and resources. 

  They were also able to make good progress on the bracket supports for the pedals. They decided that the pedal brackets could easily be 3d printed as well to save more time and resources. They also chose to only use 4 brackets, rather than the full 6 becasue we only needed three for the three support rods, and two for the attachments to the light column (one from the support rods' brackets would be used). 

  The brackets will look like this:

  With these decisions made, we should be able to print the brackets and bounce mirror sometime next week!
